Ian Dimayuga's repository for EECS 338.

Note: This repository is here for my personal version control.
I leave it public because I have a limited number of private repositories, and because it is useful for sharing my solutions AFTER the assignment has been submitted.
Please observe academic honesty and integrity and don't copy my code. At any rate, I make no guarantees as to its correctness so you'd be taking a big risk by doing so. Thanks!
